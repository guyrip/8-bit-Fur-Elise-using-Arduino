# 8-bit-Fur-Elise-using-Arduino
In this project, I made a small 8-bit music player that plays Fur Elise by Beethoven. 
The idea is simple, we only need to get the musical notes of the song that we want the Arduino to play. And enter it into the array accordingly. And that's it we got the 8-bit version of it!
